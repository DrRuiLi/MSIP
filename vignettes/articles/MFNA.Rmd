# **Introduction**

Metabolic Flux Network Analysis (MFNA) is designed for interpret the complicated isotopomers data. 

It construct a metabolic reaction network based on [KEGG reaction](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/reaction/) database, simulate atom transfer in the reaction and trace isotope source in isotopomers. Therefore MFNA could take all known metabolic reaction in consideration to perform metabolic flux network analysis.

Now it has been competent for discovering the reaction path from given isotopic tracer to isotopomer. It is still developing to integrate MSIP and MFNA to calculate metabolic flux.


# **Metabolic Flux Network Analysis**

## Atom transfer in KEGG reaction 

We collect metabolic reactions and encoding them as metabolic reaction network.

For every reaction, the constructed network consist of nodes (metabolties and reaction) and directed edges (from substrate to reaction to product).

For every reaction node, we encoding atom transfer to model the transfer of atoms between metabolites during metabolic reactions.
This is archieved by [RXNMapper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe4166).

## Network diffusion for isotope tracing

By initializing a metabolite node as tracer, and performing atom transfer recursively, we could simulate the metabolic process in a network diffsuion manner.

When a reaction node is trigerred, the atom transfer will check all isotopomers status of substrate, and output all possible isotopomers of product.

Therefore we could simulate all possible isotopomers and elaborate how they are generated from the tracer.

## Shiny GUI

To clearly comprehensively understanding the metabolic network and reaction path, we design a ShinyAPP to present:

The left panel show the metabolic flux network. The right-top panel show atom transfer and isotopomer structure.
The right-bottom table show all possible isotopomers and its generation path.

Click reaction node to view atom transfer, click a metabolite node to view its possible isotopomers, click a isotopomer to view its structure.
