# **Introduction**
This project show MSIP analysis in a data set from three type of one carbon labeled glucose tracer.
The data set is acquired from isotopic glucose traced cell samples, we use three type of tracer: 
1-^13^C Glucose, 2-^13^C Glucose and 3-^13^C Glucose to trace 293 cell line for 24h, 
and collect the cell samples for MSIP analysis.

# **Result**

We use ShinyAPP to interactively present the original MS data and the process of MSIP
