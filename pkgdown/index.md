# **MSIP**

MSIP is designed for **M**ass **S**pecrometry based **I**sotopomer **P**arsing. 
To boost comprehensive  metabolic flux analysis ( MFA ) based on **Isotopomer**.

Access our demo dataset of project [Three one carbon labeled glucose](http://www.msip.top/) for a practical biological application.

We also designed a visual tool **MFNA** for isotopomers understanding, 
see [Metabolic Flux Network Analysis](articles/MFNA.html) for more detail,
and [Metabolic Flux Network from glucose to GSH](http://47.116.220.22:8304) for demo

## **What is isotopomers **

---

• ***Isotopologues*** are molecules differing only in their isotopic composition. Two isotopologues are the same chemical species, but with at least one atom containing a different number of neutrons. The term isotopologue is derived from ‘isotope’ and ‘homologue’.


• ***Isotopomers*** are defined as molecules having the same number of each isotopic atom, but differing in their positions. The term isotopomer is a portmanteau of ‘isotope’ and ‘isomer’.

## **Why isotopomers**

---

In the complicated biological metabolic network, 
some of metabolic process could not be reflected in the isotopologues, 
especailly when mulitple reactions generating the same isotopologue but distinct isotopomers.
