## **What is isotopomers **

---

• ***Isotopologues*** are molecules differing only in their isotopic composition. Two isotopologues are the same chemical species, but with at least one atom containing a different number of neutrons. The term isotopologue is derived from ‘isotope’ and ‘homologue’.


• ***Isotopomers*** are defined as molecules having the same number of each isotopic atom, but differing in their positions. The term isotopomer is a portmanteau of ‘isotope’ and ‘isomer’.
